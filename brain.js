alert("The amygdala stores memories of frightening events and other emotional experiences. In people with anxiety disorders, the amygdala may be so sensitive that it overreacts in situations that aren't threatening. From this we can tell the amygdala is responsible for holding Holden's memory of Allies death which can be a trigger for his anxiety. This can be shown as said 'My hand still hurts me once in a while, when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist anymore-not a tight one'(Salinger 39)" );

Research has found that the hippocampus is smaller than normal in some people who were abused as children, an experience that increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.This makes it clear that the hippocampus is responsible for Holden being depressed and even wanting to kill himself as said in the text'What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide.I felt like jumping out the window.(Salinger 104)'")

It also appears to have a hand in storing memories of extinguishing fears which might occur during treatment for an anxiety disorder and turning down the fear response. Obviously Holden's adolescent prefrontal cortex is to blame for his irational decisions and his lack of fear in all countless situations such as running away as said 'Finally, what i decided I'd do I decided I'd go away. I decided I'd never go home again and I'd never go away to another school again.'(Salinger 198)  ")

For Holden however, this may serve as a rather deleterious relationship for him to live with. Two coexisting entities that's natural function results in Holden's triggering reminiscence (quote 1) and wanting to commit suicide(quote 2) on occasions where there happens to be an influx of powerful, overwhelming emotions. As illustrated by the aftermath of his, presumably, first encounter with death(The death of Allie), what we feel and think to ourselves can often transcend into physical actions and events. And as these maifested emotions begin to swelter in the mind of someone with generalized anxiety disorder, thoughts of an existencial exodus could ultimately become an object of desire(Holden pondering about his own death.).

Decisions made by the locus ceruleus such as the revival of unwanted memories that include Jane(quote 3) and Holden's own morbid isolation(quote4), often interject with one's own concious outlook as utilized by the prefrontal cortex. With this feeling of not being able to control your own thoughts, let alone your own life, a person with generalized anxiety disorder(Or even an adolescent) could act rebellious towards even their own interests to feel some sort of independence, or to have something they beleive to be their own. Holden's recurring dreams of distancing himself from school and family(quote 5) is an indicator that Holden does, like many, yearn for salvation far from where it is actually hidden. Within ourselves.")

In additon, Holden shows signs of having GAD when contemplating death.

In conclusion, we diagnos Holden Caufeild with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. ")
